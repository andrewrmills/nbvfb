                <h3>What's involved?</h3>
                <p>
                    New Brighton Brigade is split into 3 crews, awith a rotating 'duty crew', so every third weekend we are expected to be avaliable for calls</br>
                    Outside of that we are expected to turn out to calls whenever we are in the area, and able. With the minimum number off calls attended being 40%</br>
                    We also meet for training every Monday evening 7.30pm - 9.30pm
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's not all responsibility though. We are also a social bunch, regularly catching up in our crews or as a brigade.</br>
                    We have a bar on station, that is often open for rugby games and for a drink after training.

                <h3>How do I get qualified?</h3>
                <p>
                    You will learn most of what you need to know on station, during our Monday night trainings.</br>
                    Once you are ready, you will head off to Woolston Training Center, for a 7 day recruit course where you will consolidate what you have learned on station.
                    The recruit course covers things like hose drills, ladders, working at heights, knots, and conducting search and rescue, and live fire while wearing Breathing Apparatis (BA).
                    FENZ covers your wage while you are on the course, and once you have completed it, you are qualified to do everything that a firefighter is expected to do.
