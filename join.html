                <p>
                    As an urban volunteer fire brigade, New Brighton responds to all the same kind of call outs as our career counterparts. </br> 
                    This includes anything from structure and vegitation fires to medical calls and even the odd animal rescue. </br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To ensure we are maintining our skills and fufilling our responsibility to the public, all members of New Brighton Volunteer Fire Brigade are required to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attend weekly trainings on a Monday evening.</li>
                        <li>Ensure we are avaliable from Friday evening until Monday morning every third week.</li>
                        <li>Maintain a minimum average of 40% call out attendance.</li>
                    </ul>
